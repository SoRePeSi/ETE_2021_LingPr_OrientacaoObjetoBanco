# ETE_2021_LingPr_OrientacaoObjetoBanco

This is a school activity

We were required to use the concepts of Object Orientation in C#, in order to create a bank system to:
  - Create 3 accounts, 3 sellers and 1 manager
  - Calculate the bonus, total earnings and total vacation days for each employee and the total accounts created

I, of course, made it more complicated than necessary
This is my solution
